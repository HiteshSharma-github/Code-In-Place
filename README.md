# Code-In-Place (STANFORD UNIVERSITY - Internship)

This is a project in which I made a BRICK BUSTER GAME which is having a touch of cool 90's game. I used python and with the help of pygame module I made the game. In this the paddle can move only in right and left direction .The rectangular ball will rebounce in opposite direction when touches the wall. Contray to the convention , when the ball hits the bottom wall it again reappear from the centre of the window . The game is supposed to be done in 3 mins. If one is able to do so, an image with the message "GAME OVER ,THANKS FOR PLAYING " will pop up. If one is unable to do so an image will pop up with message "TIMES UP" . Also , there are 10 different color layer of bricks which changes with the restart of the program.
